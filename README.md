# ScienceDbBackend

This is a skeleton NodeJS project using the technology explained in this [Blog post](http://mherman.org/blog/2015/10/22/node-postgres-sequelize/#.VijvshNViko).

The package is meant to integrate with Code Generators enabling the quick and easy definition and migration of (scientific) data models. See:

* [Data Model Code Generation](https://github.com/asishallab/express_route_gen_js)
* [Graphical User Interface as Single Page Web Application (VueJS)](https://github.com/asishallab/ScienceDbGui)
